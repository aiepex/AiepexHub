description: "Privacy policy for MinimalHabitTrackerX, a fully local, zero-data-collection habit tracking application by Aiepex."
---

**Effective Date:** February 16, 2026

Aiepex ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the MinimalHabitTrackerX Android application (the "App").

Our core philosophy for this App is complete privacy. **MinimalHabitTrackerX operates entirely locally on your device and does not collect, track, or transmit any personal data.**

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Because MinimalHabitTrackerX is designed as a secure, private tool for tracking personal habits, streaks, and milestones, we have intentionally built the App to function without data collection. 

When you use the App, **we DO NOT collect:**
* **Personal Identification Information:** We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifying information.
* **Account Data:** The App requires no account creation, login, or authentication.
* **Usage Data and Analytics:** We do not track how you use the App, which buttons you press, or how frequently you open it.
* **Habit Data:** The specific habits you track, your streaks, and your progress are completely invisible to us. 
* **Device Information:** We do not log your IP address, device ID, operating system version, or mobile network information.

## 2. Local Data Storage

All data generated by your use of the App (such as your tracked days, habit names, and current streaks) is stored locally and securely on your device's internal storage. 

* **Your Data Stays With You:** This data never leaves your device. It is not synced to the cloud, it is not sent to our servers, and it is not shared with any third parties.
* **Data Deletion:** Because the data is stored only on your device, you have complete control over it. You can delete all your habit data at any time by clearing the App's data in your Android device settings or by uninstalling the App. Once uninstalled, the data cannot be recovered.

## 3. Permissions

MinimalHabitTrackerX is designed to require the absolute minimum permissions necessary to function on your Android device. We do not request invasive permissions such as access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or location. 

*(If your app requests permission to send local notifications for daily reminders, that occurs strictly on-device and does not involve external servers).*

## 4. Third-Party Services and Tracking

We do not integrate any third-party tracking, analytics, or advertising frameworks (such as Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or ad networks) into MinimalHabitTrackerX. Your usage remains completely unmonitored by external entities.

## 5. Children's Privacy

MinimalHabitTrackerX does not intentionally collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your country), as it does not collect personal information from anyone. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, though we have no mechanism to collect or store such data.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. However, our commitment to a fully local, zero-data-collection experience for MinimalHabitTrackerX will not change. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.
